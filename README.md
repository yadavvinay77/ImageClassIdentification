# ImageClassIdentification
This is an image processing project for clasifying 10 classes of images to identifying various categories of animals.


# Image Clustering and Feature Importance with TensorFlow

This Python script demonstrates image clustering and feature importance analysis using TensorFlow. The script uses a pre-trained InceptionResNetV2 model to extract features from images and then applies clustering to group similar images. Additionally, it evaluates the model's performance, plots training and validation accuracy/loss, and generates a confusion matrix to assess classification results.

## Prerequisites

- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn

Install the required libraries using the following:

pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy scikit-learn seaborn

Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-clustering-feature-importance.git
cd image-clustering-feature-importance

# Run the script:

python image_clustering_feature_importance.py

View the output: Randomly selected images with class names and sizes.
Training and validation accuracy/loss plots.
Confusion matrix visualizing classification results.

# Customization

Modify the data_dir variable to point to your dataset directory.
Adjust batch_size and num_epochs for training.
Explore and customize clustering and feature importance sections as needed.
# Output

Randomly selected images with class names and sizes.
Training and validation accuracy/loss plots.
Confusion matrix visualizing classification results.

# Notes
The script utilizes TensorFlow and pre-trained InceptionResNetV2 for feature extraction.
Data augmentation is applied during training using ImageDataGenerator.
